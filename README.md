=======

A simple mumble bot built off the mumble-ruby library, with the ability to control an MPD server, with more to come...

--Not touched since 2018. Bot is broken because of libspotify. Maybe this project can be revived with spotifyd. 

Requirements:

Gem           | Reason
------------- | -------------
mumble-ruby   | For Mumble API
ruby-mpd      | For MPD Control
cinch         | For future IRC project
colorize      | For pretty console output, and future debugging.
